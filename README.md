# About

Imagine playing a game, specifically Assetto Corsa Competizione, and you wished there was a way to read its shared memory. Here's your solution.

# Usage

1 - Make sure you are able to somehow compile C++

2 - Make sure you downloaded the file

3 - Compile and run

# Disclaimer

This will NOT print anything, you have to write your own implementation for that, or wait till I write one and upload it here.

This probably leaks OS resources, we don't know, we also don't care.

# Notice

By the way, I am working on a side project. It's a drop in replacement for the cluttered mess that is MoTeC I2. In the context of Assetto Corsa Competizione, MoTeC doesn't support real time telemetry, which is the gap I intend to fill. If that sounds interesting to you, sign up for the waitlist, because it is coming SOON.

Waitlist link coming soon too XD
